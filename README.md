This is a tutorial to build a very simple web app with iobio. It will include
 * Grabbing some genomic data using websockets
 * Visualizing the data
 * Customizing the Visualization

Each step below has a directory in this repo. If things go wrong somewhere along the way you can simply start with the example file (e.g. app.step2.html) in the step directory you are currently at.

## Step 1 - Get Genomic Data

## Step 2 - Create UI For Data Selection

## Step 3 - Create iobio Command

## Step 4 - Create Visualization

## Step 5 - Hook Up Data to Visualization

## Step 6 - Improve visualization - different color for fwd, rev or all match or something?
