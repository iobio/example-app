# IOBIO Example App

This is a tutorial to build a very simple web app with iobio. It will include
 * Grabbing some genomic data using websockets
 * Visualizing the data
 * Customizing the Visualization

We will be making use of a few iobio libraries including:
 * [```iobio.js```](https://github.com/iobio/iobio.js) - create commands and handle websocket creation and returning data
 * [```iobio.viz```](https://github.com/iobio/iobio.viz) - visualization library that handles streaming data

To learn more about these libraries go to there home pages linked above.

Each step below has a directory in this repo. If things go wrong somewhere along the way you can simply copy the example file (e.g. app.step2.html) in the step directory you are currently at.
